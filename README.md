# Loophole

Loophole is an open-source AI code editor. It is a fork of the Void editor, which is a fork of VS Code.

## Project Background

Loophole is built on top of the Void editor. Void itself started as a fork of VS Code to integrate AI features directly into the core editor experience. Loophole continues this mission with a focus on privacy, flexibility, and a premium user experience.

## Main Features

- AI Chat Sidebar: Chat with your entire codebase using advanced AI models.
- Context Awareness: Loophole understands your code structure and relationships.
- Multiple Providers: Connect to various AI providers or host your own.
- Privacy First: AI requests are sent directly from your machine to the provider. No intermediate servers store your data.

## Supported AI Providers

Loophole supports a wide range of AI providers, including:

- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, etc.)
- OpenAI (GPT-4o, etc.)
- Google Gemini (Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash)
- DeepSeek
- OpenRouter (Aggregator for many models)
- Local Providers:
  - Ollama
  - vLLM
  - LM Studio
- Other compatible providers: Groq, xAI, Mistral, Perplexity, and more.
